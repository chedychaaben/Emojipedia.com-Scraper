<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A yellow face with a half-frown and white bandage wrapped around its head, often depicted partially over one eye. May represent physical injury or pain but also emotional hurting, sometimes for ironic effect.</p>
<p>Differs from other smileys conveying illness, such as <a href="/nauseated-face/">ðŸ¤¢ Nauseated Face</a> (appearing as if itâ€™s going to vomit) or <a href="/face-with-thermometer/">ðŸ¤’ Face With Thermometer</a> (used especially for colds and flus).</p>
<p>
<em>Face with Head-Bandage</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-8.0/">Unicode 8.0</a> in 2015 and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
