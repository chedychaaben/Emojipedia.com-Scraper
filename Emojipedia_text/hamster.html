<p>Often used with an affectionate tone. May be used to represent a gerbil, guinea pig, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinchilla">chinchilla</a>, or related animals. Does not have a full-bodied hamster emoji counterpart.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with <a href="/mouse-trap/">🐭 Mouse Face</a>.</p>
