<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A yellow face with a hand covering its mouth. Displays most often with smiling eyes and/or blushing cheeks, suggesting coy laughter or embarrassment, as if cheekily saying <i>Oops! </i></p>
<p>Prior to the release of <a href="/apple/ios-15.4/">iOS 15.4</a> in March 2022, Apple's design <a href="/apple/ios-11.1/face-with-hand-over-mouth/">featured</a> simple, open eyes, suggesting someone gasping <i>Oh my!</i> in serious surprise, shock, concern, or apology. This same update assigned Apple's original 🤭 design to <a href="/emoji-14.0/">Emoji 14.0</a>'s new <a href="/face-with-open-eyes-and-hand-over-mouth/">🫢 Face with Open Eyes and Hand Over Mouth</a> emoji.</p>
<p>May be used to similar effect as <a href="/speak-no-evil-monkey/">🙊 Speak-No-Evil Monkey.</a> See also <a href="/zipper-mouth-face/">🤐 Zipper-Mouth Face</a>. Joins <a href="/hugging-face/">🤗 Hugging Face</a>, <a href="/thinking-face/">🤔 Thinking Face</a>, and <a href="/shushing-face/">🤫 Shushing Face</a> as one of the few smileys featuring hands.</p>
<p>Facebook's design <a href="/facebook/4.0/face-with-hand-over-mouth/">previously featured</a> open eyes, though an earlier version had <a href="/facebook/2.1/face-with-hand-over-mouth/">smiling eyes</a> like those in the vendor's current design.</p>
<p>
<em>Face with Hand Over Mouth</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-10.0/">Unicode 10.0</a> in 2017 under the name “Smiling Face with Smiling Eyes and Hand Covering Mouth” and added to <a href="/emoji-5.0/">Emoji 5.0</a> in 2017.
