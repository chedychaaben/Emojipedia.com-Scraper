<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>Sheets of white, printed paper with variously colored tabs to bookmark important sections or indicate signature lines. Commonly used for content concerning various types of documents and writing.</p>
<p>The number of pages and tabs vary, with Microsoft and Twitterâ€™s designs featuring one page with a single, purple-colored tab. Facebookâ€™s is printed with <i>NDA</i>, or <i>nondisclosure agreement</i>. Most platforms indicate text with dark lines. Appleâ€™s design features an easter egg, addressed <i>Dear Katie</i> and signed <i>Take care</i> from <a href="https://www.mactrast.com/2017/05/who-exactly-is-john-appleseed/"><em>J</em><i>ohn Appleseed</i></a> with the text of its 1997â€“2002 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different"><i>Crazy Ones</i>/<i>Think Different</i></a> ad campaign:</p>
<p><em>Hereâ€™s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. Theyâ€™re not fond of rules. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you canâ€™t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.</em></p>
