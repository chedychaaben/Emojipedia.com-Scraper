<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A face with open eyes and a small, open frown. Its eyebrows are furrowed, with a single bead of cold sweat dripping down, and its forehead is pale blue, as if experiencing a <a href="/cold-face/">cold</a> flash. Samsung's design shows upper teeth and tongue.</p>
<p>Meaning widely varies, but commonly conveys such feelings as sadness, disappointment, fear, and anxiety. Similar to <a href="/sad-but-relieved-face/">😥 Sad but Relieved Face</a>, but with a blue head and larger frown.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with <a href="/crying-face/">😢 Crying Face</a>, <a href="/sleepy-face/">😪 Sleepy Face</a>, or other emojis with tear or sweat droplets. <a href="/microsoft/windows-8.1/anxious-face-with-sweat/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="/samsung/touchwiz-7.1/anxious-face-with-sweat/">Samsung</a> previously featured smileys that appeared more excited in expression.</p>
<p>
<em>Anxious Face with Sweat</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 under the name “Face with Open Mouth and Cold Sweat” and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
