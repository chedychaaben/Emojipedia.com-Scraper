<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A white piece of paper, its top right corner curled or dog-eared, with text printed on it, as a business letter or icon for a document on a computer. Commonly used for content concerning various types of documents and writing.</p>
<p>Most platforms indicate text with dark lines. Appleâ€™s design features an easter egg, addressed <i>Dear Katie</i> and signed <i>Take care</i> from <a href="https://www.mactrast.com/2017/05/who-exactly-is-john-appleseed/"><em>John Appleseed</em></a> with the text of its 1997â€“2002 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different"><i>Crazy Ones</i>/</a><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different">Think Different</a> </i>ad campaign:</p>
<p><em>Hereâ€™s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. Theyâ€™re not fond of rules. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you canâ€™t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.</em></p>
