<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A white piece of paper, curled up at the bottom to the left or right, with text printed on it, as a business letter. Commonly used for content concerning various types of documents and writing.</p>
<p>Most platforms indicate text with dark lines. Appleâ€™s design features an easter egg, addressed <i>Dear Katie</i> with text from its 1997â€“2002 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different"><i>Crazy Ones/Think Different</i></a> ad campaign:</p>
<p><em>Hereâ€™s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward</em>â€¦</p>
