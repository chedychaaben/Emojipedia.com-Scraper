<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A lobster, a large crustacean with a prominent tail and pincers. Depicted as a reddish-orange lobster (as cooked) from above, with a long body and tail, short, tentacle-like eyes, and ten legs, the top of which are very large pincers.</p>
<p>Often used to represent lobster as food as well as in connection to the US state of Maine.</p>
<p>In its release year of 2018, Emojipediaâ€™s original sample image was criticized as anatomically incorrect but was shortly after <a href="http://blog.emojipedia.org/skateboard-dna-and-lobster-updated/">resolved</a>. That year, the transgender community <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/trans-activists-lobster-emoji-flag-charlie-craggs-unicode-nail-it-a8474476.html">embraced</a> the lobster as a symbol for their efforts for <a href="/transgender-flag/">Transgender Flag</a>Â emoji.</p>
<p>Samsung, WhatsApp, and Facebookâ€™s lobsters are depicted at an angle.</p>
<p>
<em>Lobster</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-11.0/">Unicode 11.0</a> in 2018 and added to <a href="/emoji-11.0/">Emoji 11.0</a> in 2018.
