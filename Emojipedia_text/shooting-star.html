<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A stylized representation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_Star">shooting star</a>, a small, fast meteor that burns up in the atmosphere. Generally depicted as a gold, five-point star trailing yellow motion lines against a night sky, as if moving down to the left.</p>
<p>May be used for astronomical stars and other content concerning space. Also may be used for flair or flourish. Sometimes used as a visual reference to NBC’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_More_You_Know"><em>More You Know</em></a> public service announcement, popular in the 1990s and featuring a shooting star logo.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with <a href="/dizzy/">💫 Dizzy</a>, <a href="/star/">⭐ Star</a>, <a href="/glowing-star/">🌟 Glowing Star</a>, or <a href="/sparkles/">✨ Sparkles</a>, though their applications may overlap.</p>
<p>Google’s star was <a href="/google/android-8.0/shooting-star/">previously</a> trailed, without backdrop, by yellow lines, though these lines were blue in an even <a href="/google/android-7.0/shooting-star/">earlier</a> design. Microsoft’s star was also previously trailed, without backdrop, by blue lines, though they were <a href="/microsoft/windows-10/shooting-star/">yellow before</a> that.</p>
<p>
<em>Shooting Star</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
