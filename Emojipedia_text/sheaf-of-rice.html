<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A rice plant, as grown before harvesting and processing. Depicted as a sheaf of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryza_sativa">Asian rice</a> with green leaves and yellow seed heads drooping over to the right or left. Sometimes assumed to be wheat.</p>
<p>May be used to represent a variety of cereal grains (e.g., wheat, corn, oats, sorghum) as well as crops, fields and harvests, and farming more generally.</p>
<p>This emoji is occassionally used in the place of the word 'white' as in, a <a href="/light-skin-tone/">white skin tone</a>. This form of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/voldemorting-ultimate-seo-diss-resident-linguist/">Voldemorting</a> is potentially due to the similarity of the words 'white' and 'wheat', and used <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/kp0boe/what_is_the_deal_with_using_the_grain_emoji/">in online discussions</a> where it is undesirable to have the actual word written out.</p>
<p>
<em>Sheaf of Rice</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 under the name “Ear of Rice” and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
