<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A yellow face with big glasses, a large nose, thick eyebrows, and a mustache. Used to represent someone in disguise.</p>
<p>The features of this particular disguised face are taken from the “Groucho Mask” or “Groucho Glasses,” designed in the likeness of the caricature played by Julius Henry Marx in the Marx Brothers' films. These comedic films were popular in the 1930s and ‘40s, and the mask has been a mainstay of joke shops since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/18/books/there-ain-t-no-sanity-claus.html">as early as the 1940s</a>.</p>
<p>Other emoji faces in disguise include <a href="/superhero/">🦸 Superhero</a> and <a href="/supervillain/">🦹 Supervillain</a>.</p>
<p>
<em>Disguised Face</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-13.0/">Unicode 13.0</a> in 2020 and added to <a href="/emoji-13.0/">Emoji 13.0</a> in 2020.
