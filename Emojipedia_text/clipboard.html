<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A white piece of paper secured by a silver clip on a brown clipboard, as used as a writing surface when standing. Commonly used for content concerning various types of documents and writing, especially in sports.</p>
<p>Many platforms indicate text with dark lines. WhatsAppâ€™s design shows lined paper. Facebookâ€™s features the easter egg of a table with first names and numbers, perhaps as birthdates:</p>
<p><em>Matt 3/28<br/>
Louie 4/30<br/>
Alexa 6/17<br/>
Brian 8/06</em></p>
<p>Appleâ€™s design also features an easter egg, addressed <i>Dear Katie</i> and signed <i>Take care</i> from <em><a href="https://www.mactrast.com/2017/05/who-exactly-is-john-appleseed/">John Appleseed</a></em> with the text of its 1997â€“2002 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different"><i>Crazy Ones</i>/<i>Think Different</i></a> ad campaign:</p>
<p><i>Hereâ€™s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. Theyâ€™re not fond of rules. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you canâ€™t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.</i></p>

<em>Clipboard</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
