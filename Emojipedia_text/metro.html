<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A metro: frequent underground train found in built-up areas with high populations.</p>
<p>This emoji is generally displayed as a forward-facing train, with some platforms also displaying a tunnel as a circle surrounding the train. Apple's artwork shows the charactersÂ <em>IL2</em>Â which may be a reference to one of the more <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-infinite-loop-oral-history/">locked-down buildingsÂ at Apple's Infinite Loop</a> Headquarters during iPhone developmentÂ (IL2 = Infinite Loop 2).</p>
<p>
<em>Metro</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
