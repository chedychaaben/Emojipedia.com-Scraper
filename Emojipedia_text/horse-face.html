<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>The face of a horse, generally facing left. Depicted as a light or reddish-brown horse with a dark brown or black mane, and, on many platforms, a light-colored muzzle.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with the full-bodied <a href="/horse/">🐎 Horse</a> or <a href="/horse-racing/">🏇 Horse Racing</a>, though their applications may overlap. Some vendors implement a similar design in <a href="/unicorn/">🦄 Unicorn Face</a> and <a href="/zebra/">🦓 Zebra</a>.</p>
<p>WhatsApp’s horse is facing left, as Facebook’s <a href="/facebook/1.0/horse-face/">previously</a> was. Microsoft’s horse was <a href="/microsoft/windows-10/horse-face/">previously</a> looking straight ahead, as was <a href="/samsung/experience-9.0/horse-face/">Samsung’s</a>, shown with a goofy, full-toothed grin. Softbank <a href="/softbank/2006/horse-face/">previously</a> featured a full-bodied horse.</p>
<p>
<em>Horse Face</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
