<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A hedgehog. AÂ small, spiny mammal sometimes kept as a pet. Generally depicted in full profile on all fours facing left, with a round, brown body covered with spines andÂ a light-brown face and underside.</p>
<p>Sometimes used to represent a porcupine or echidna.</p>
<p>Twitter's design has always been a hedgehog facing forward. Google's design originally featured a hedgehog facing forward, though it was changed to full profile with Android 11.0. Facebookâ€™s design <a href="/facebook/2.1/hedgehog/">previously</a> featured a hedgehogÂ on its back, rolled up in a ball.</p>
