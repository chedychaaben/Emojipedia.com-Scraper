<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A baby chicken (chick), hatching from an egg and seeing the world for the first time. Depicted as a yellow chick with an orange beak facing forward in the cracked, bottom half of a white egg, generally shown flapping its wings with a cute facial expression.</p>
<p>Often used with an affectionate tone. May be used to represent various types of baby birds. May also be used to represent chicken foods (e.g., <a href="/poultry-leg/">poultry</a>, <a href="/egg/">eggs</a>), <a href="/spring/">spring</a>, <a href="/easter/">Easter</a>, or slang senses of <i>chick</i>.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with <a href="/baby-chick/">🐤 Baby Chick</a> or <a href="/front-facing-baby-chick/">🐥Front-Facing Baby Chick</a> (out of its egg), though their applications overlap. See also <a href="/chicken/">🐔 Chicken</a> and <a href="/rooster/">🐓 Rooster</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter and Facebook's designs do not include wings. Google's design <a href="/google/android-7.0/hatching-chick/">previously</a> featured motion lines around the chick's wings, indicating flapping. Facebook's design <a href="/facebook/2.0/hatching-chick/">previously</a> showed part of the egg atop the chick's head.</p>
<p>
<em>Hatching Chick</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
