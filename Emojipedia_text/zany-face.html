<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A yellow face with its head tilted, its tongue hanging out of a big grin, and wide eyes in a wild, cockeyed expression. Generally used to express silliness.</p>
<p>Commonly represents acting goofy, having fun, and partying and is usually used in a positive manner. May be used in reference to someone or something that is off-kilter.</p>
<p><a href="/microsoft/windows-10-fall-creators-update/zany-face/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="/whatsapp/2.17/zany-face/">WhatsApp</a> previously displayed a full-toothed grin instead of an open mouth with a protruding tongue, which appeared less silly and more menacing. <a href="/google/android-8.0/zany-face/">Google's</a> design used to show the mouth in a grimace, which also read as more disturbing than silly.</p>
<p>
