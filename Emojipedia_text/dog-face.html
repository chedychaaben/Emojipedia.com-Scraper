<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A friendly, cartoon-styled face of a dog, looking straight ahead. Depicted as the face of a dog of various breeds, generally light-brown and white, with pointed or floppy ears and its tongue hanging out.</p>
<p>May be used with a more playful tone than the full-bodied <a href="/dog/">🐕 Dog</a>, though their applications generally overlap. See also <a href="/poodle/">🐩 Poodle</a>.</p>
<p>One of the 12 animals of the <a href="/chinese-new-year/">Chinese zodiac</a>. Available as an Apple <a href="/animoji/">Animoji</a>.</p>
<p>Many vendors implement the same or similar dog as their full-bodied <a href="/dog/">🐕 Dog</a>, such as Google and Facebook. Apple and WhatsApp’s dogs have a white face with brown, floppy ears and a brown patch over one eye.</p>
<p>Included in the earliest Japanese emoji sets from <a href="/softbank/1997/dog-face/">Softbank</a>, <a href="/docomo/1999/dog-face/">Docomo</a>, and <a href="/au-kddi/type-a-2/dog-face/">au by KDDI</a>.</p>

<em>Dog Face</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
