<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A smiling yellow face with glasses, often with teeth showing, originally buck teeth on most platforms.</p>
<p>While this emoji is often used by people calling themselves nerds in a self-deprecating way, the nerdy glasses paired with buck teeth can, and often does, evoke anti-Asian stereotypes. The fact that the default color of emoji faces is yellow further pushes this emoji into racist "<a href="https://hyperallergic.com/189200/asians-meet-new-yellow-emoji-with-frowny-face/">yellowface</a>"Â territory.</p>
<p>Some platforms have redesigned <i>nerd face</i>Â over time to not have buck teeth, perhaps in acknowledgement of the harm this imageryÂ may cause. Google, Facebook, and JoyPixels <a href="/google/android-7.0/nerd-face/">originally</a> <a href="/facebook/2.0/nerd-face/">featured</a> <a href="/joypixels/4.0/nerd-face/">designs</a> with buck teeth but have since changed (or completely removed) the teeth on <em>nerd face</em>.</p>
<p>Apple, Twitter, Microsoft, Samsung, WhatsApp, and other platforms still use designs for this emoji that include buck teeth.</p>
<p>
<em>Nerd Face</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-8.0/">Unicode 8.0</a> in 2015 and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
