<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A graph showing a colored trend line, often blue, decreasing over time, as stock prices or revenues. Commonly used to represent various types of decrease, from numeral data to being metaphorically down. May also represent facts, figures, and charts more generally.</p>
<p>WhatsApp’s line is red, while Facebook’s orange. Google’s line was <a href="/google/android-12.0/chart-decreasing/">previously</a> green.</p>
<p>While many western countries use red to indicate a negative result, Japan and other south east Asian countries <a href="/chart-increasing/">use red in a positive context</a>.</p>
<p>
<em>Chart Decreasing</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 under the name “Chart with Downwards Trend” and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
