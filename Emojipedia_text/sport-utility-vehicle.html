<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A blue or green Sport Utility Vehicle or station wagon, often with a spare tire on the back. Commonly used as a generic blue or green car.</p>
<p><em>Sport Utility Vehicle</em> or <em>SUV</em> is an emoji whose meaning was likely lost in translation as it moved from Japanese phone carriers to the Unicode Standard in 2010.</p>
<p>This emoji goes back to the late 1990s when it was <a href="/docomo/1999/sport-utility-vehicle/">included in Docomo's emoji set</a>. In 2009, it appeared on a <a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2009/09026r-emoji-proposed.pdf">proposal</a> as one of many symbols available on Japanese phones recommended to be encoded into the Unicode Standard. In that proposal, the symbol was referred to as a "recreational vehicle" or RV. The original Japanese emojis look more like station wagons or SUVs than RVs.</p>
<p>At various points, platforms including Google and Samsung showed this emoji as an RV, but ultimately the designs across platforms converged to a car that looks more like an SUV or station wagon. At a small scale this emoji is barely distinguishable from <a href="/automobile/">üöó Automobile</a> on some platforms.</p>
<p>
<em>Sport Utility Vehicle</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 under the name ‚ÄúRecreational Vehicle‚Äù and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
