<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>Two hands placed firmly together, meaning <i>please</i> or <em>thank you</em> in Japanese culture. A common alternative use for this emoji is for prayer, using the same gesture as praying hands. It can also represent a respectful greeting or show of adoration many in Southeast Asian religions and cultures, such as the Hindu <em>namaste</em> or Buddhist <em>añjali mudra</em>.</p>
<p>Rarely used as a high-five, despite often being suggested as one by emoji keyboard search features. <a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/emojiology-folded-hands/">More about this emoji and its possible meanings</a>.</p>
<p>A previous version of this emoji displayed a <a href="/apple/ios-6.0/folded-hands/" title="🙏 Person With Folded Hands on Apple iOS 6.0">yellow burst of light behind the two hands</a> on iOS. Android once showed a blob-character with <a href="/google/android-5.0/folded-hands/" title="🙏 Person With Folded Hands on Google Android 5.0">closed eyes and folded hands</a>.</p>
<p>
<em>Folded Hands</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 under the name “Person with Folded Hands” and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
