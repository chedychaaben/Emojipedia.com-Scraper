<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A squid, an octopus-like sea animal with ten arms. Generally depicted as a pinkish-orange <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_squid">giant squid</a>, facing forward or angled to the left, with a slender, arrow-like body, small eyes, and two, long arms raised up at its sides. Platforms generally depict six arms.</p>
<p>Occasionally used to represent squid as a food item. Not to be confused with <a href="/octopus/">🐙 Octopus</a>, though their applications may overlap.</p>
<p>Microsoft, WhatsApp and Twitter’s squid designs are facing forward, as was a previous <a href="/google/android-8.0/squid/">Google</a> design. Samsung’s squid was <a href="/samsung/experience-9.0/squid/">previously</a> gray.</p>
