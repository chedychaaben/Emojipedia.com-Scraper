<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>Boo! A white, cartoon ghost making a silly face. Its tongue is stuck out and arms are outstretched, as if trying to scare someone in a friendly way. Several platforms feature one larger, bulging eye, while others show the ghost winking.</p>
<p>Resembles a classic ghost costume for <a href="/halloween/">Halloween</a>. May also be used to convey something or someone is fun or goofy. Thanks to its raised arms, some use thisÂ emoji as a way of expressing an excitedÂ <em>Yay!</em></p>
<p>May also be used to refer to the slang term "ghosting", where aÂ personal relationship is endedÂ suddenly without explanation by one person withdrawing from all communication with another.</p>
<p>Samsung's design <a href="/samsung/touchwiz-7.0/ghost/">previously depicted</a> this as a smiley in a ghost costume.</p>
<p>
<em>Ghost</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
