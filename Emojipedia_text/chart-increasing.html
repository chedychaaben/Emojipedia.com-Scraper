<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A graph showing a red (or sometimes green) trend line increasing over time, as stock prices or revenues. Commonly used to represent various types of increase, from numerical data to being metaphorically on the rise. May also represent trending content as well as facts, figures, and charts more generally.</p>
<p>Note: red is used to <a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/why-does-the-chart-increasing-emoji-show-in-red/">represent increases in stock prices in Japan</a>, where this emoji originates.</p>
<p>
<em>Chart Increasing</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 under the name “Chart with Upwards Trend” and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
