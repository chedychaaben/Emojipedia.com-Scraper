<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A face blowing the wind, as a personification of nature (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Nature">Mother Nature</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_wind">North Wind</a>) who creates the wind by blowing air from its mouth. Depicted as a gray, profile of a human face, generally with a feminine appearance, blowing swirls from her mouth to the right.</p>
<p>May be used to represent windy weather. Occasionally used to represent clouds, fog, smoke, and smoking. Not to be confused with Dashing Away, though their applications may overlap.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s design is blue, as is Facebook’s, whose design most clearly suggests a woman’s face. WhatsApp’s design depicts a cloud with a face, as Samsung’s <a href="/samsung/experience-9.0/wind-face/">previously</a> did.</p>
<p>
<em>Wind Face</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-7.0/">Unicode 7.0</a> in 2014 under the name “Wind Blowing Face” and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
