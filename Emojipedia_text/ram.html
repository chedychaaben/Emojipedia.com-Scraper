<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A ram, a male sheep with large, spiraling horns. Generally depicted in full profile on all fours facing left with a thick, white fleece and light-brown horns.</p>
<p>Occasionally used to represent antelopes and related animals. Not to be confused with <a href="/ewe/">🐑 Ewe</a>, though their applications may overlap.</p>
<p>Often considered (in lieu of <a href="/goat/">🐐 Goat</a>) one of the 12 animals of the <a href="/chinese-new-year/">Chinese zodiac</a>. Also often used to represent <a href="/aries/">♈ Aries</a> (the Ram) in the Western zodiac.</p>
<p>WhatsApp and Facebook’s designs resemble a bighorn sheep, as <a href="/apple/ios-10.2/ram/">Apple’s</a> once did. Google's design <a href="/google/android-8.0/ram/">previously</a> had its eyes closed.</p>
<p>
<em>Ram</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
