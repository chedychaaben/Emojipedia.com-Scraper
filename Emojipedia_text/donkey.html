<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A grey donkey or mule, shown in full profile, sometimes with its hind legs kicking into the air.</p>
<p>Can be used literally to represent the pack animal. Can also be used metaphorically to call someone a <em>jackass</em> or to say that someone is <em>stubborn as a mule</em>.</p>
<p>Because the donkey is a symbol of the Democratic Party of the United States, it may be used in political contexts. Additionally, the term <em>mule</em> can refer to someone who carries illegal drugs across borders, so this emoji may be used to talk about smugglers and the act of smuggling.</p>
