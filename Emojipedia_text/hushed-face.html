<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A yellow face with small, open eyes, raised eyebrows, and a small,Â open mouth, as if it has been hushed by concern or correction. Meaning widely varies, but its expression is commonly taken as surprise, embarrassment, or mildÂ excitement.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="/astonished-face/">ðŸ˜²Â Astonished Face</a>, which features larger eyes and mouth.Â Google <a href="/google/android-5.0/hushed-face/">previously interpreted</a> <i>hushed</i> as "silenced,"Â depictingÂ the emoji with a <a href="/zipper-mouth-face/">zipper mouth</a> until <a href="/google/android-6.0.1/">Android 6.0.1</a>. An earlyÂ MicrosoftÂ design <a href="/microsoft/windows-8.1/hushed-face/">featured</a> a face with closed eyes and a flat, closed mouth.</p>
<p>
<em>Hushed Face</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.1/">Unicode 6.1</a> in 2012 and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
