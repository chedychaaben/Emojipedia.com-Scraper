<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A house, otherwise known as a home when someone is living in it. Suitable for a couple or larger family, other perhaps housemates.</p>
<p>Distinct from an apartment building due to its detached form, this house is likely in the suburbs of a city or a rural area.</p>
<p>
<em>House</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-6.0/">Unicode 6.0</a> in 2010 under the name “House Building” and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
