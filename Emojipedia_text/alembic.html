<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>An apparatus for distilling, as used in medieval <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy">alchemy</a>. Generally depicted as a round flask with a neck angled down to the right. Positioned on a short stand and containing a mysterious green, purple, or blue liquid.</p>
<p>Commonly used for various content concerning chemistry and science more generally. May represent various liquids, such as potions or medicines, as well as metaphorical laboratories and experiments.</p>
<p>Thanks to the alembic’s association with alchemy, this emoji may also convey a sense of magic. And, thanks to its resemblance to a glass pipe, some use the emoji to represent a bong or other drug paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Samsung’s design <a href="/samsung/experience-9.0/alembic/">previously featured</a> a copper still, as used for making <a href="/tumbler-glass/">whiskey</a>.</p>
