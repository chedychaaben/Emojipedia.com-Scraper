<h2>Emoji Meaning</h2>
<p>A hand holding a <a href="/pen/" title="🖊 Lower Left Ballpoint Pen">pen</a> or <a href="/pencil/" title="✏️ Pencil">pencil</a> and writing. Most often shown as holding either a blue or black pen, though Microsoft's design has a red pen. LG's design displays a left hand, while all other platforms show a right hand. Used broadly to represent writing.</p>
<p>Also used between words to show that a lesson is being learned and to indicate someone is taking notes. For example, <em>✍️look✍️both✍️ways✍️before✍️you✍️cross✍️the✍️street</em>. This use was popularized in <a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/what-happens-in-the-tiktok-comments/">TikTok comments</a>. It uses the established practice of placing emojis between words for emphasis. Possibly influenced by the emphatic use of <a href="/clapping-hands/">👏 Clapping Hands</a>, which reflects speech-gesture pairings in Black English in the United States.</p>
<p>
<em>Writing Hand</em> was approved as part of <a href="/unicode-1.1/">Unicode 1.1</a> in 1993 and added to <a href="/emoji-1.0/">Emoji 1.0</a> in 2015.
